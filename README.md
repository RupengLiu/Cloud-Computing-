### Basics

Program counter: is an index into the code, which says where the program is executing right now.

### What is a Cloud?
There are two kinds of clouds, a single-site cloud or a geo-distributed or geographically distributed cloud. A single-site cloud, known as a Datacenter often, consists of the following components, of course, it have been source of servers or compute nodes, these are grouped into racks, a rack as a unit of several servers which typically share the same power and often share a top of the rack switch. This top of the rack switches are often connected via a network topology. 

### MapReduce 
Examples :
1. Distributed grep: input: large set of files; output: lines that matches the pattern
2. Reverse Web-link graph: Map: process web log and for each input <source, target>, output <target, source>; reduce: emits <target, list<source>>
3. Count of URL access frequency: input: Log of accessed URL from proxy server; output: for each URL, calculate % total access from that URL. 
4. Sorting: map: quicksort; reduce: merge sort (make sure key are increasing/decreasing)
